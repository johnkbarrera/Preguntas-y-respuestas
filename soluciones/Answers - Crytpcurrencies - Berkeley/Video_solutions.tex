			Alice is paying for a service using bitcoin micropayments. If she simply disconnects at some point without notifying Bob and stops sending micropayments. What can Bob do?
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Bob is out of luck. He doesn't earn any bitcoin and must pursue legal recourse
				\item Bob can redeem the maximum amount that Alice initially escrowed into a multisig address
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Bob can redeem the latest micropayment transaction that Alice sent in the last time period before disconnecting, which matches the length of services she received.}
				\item Bob can refuse to sign the refund transaction, so both Alice and Bob will end up losing Bitcoins, which will sit in the multisig escrow forever
			\end{enumerate}
			\vspace{3mm} %5mm vertical space

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The transaction that reaches the majority of nodes first will win
				\item The transactions that was broadcast first will win
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{The miner who finds the next block will likely resolve the tie by including one of the transactions in the block}
				\item Each node has its own version of the block chain containing the transaction that it heard about first

			In a prediction market where shares pay out if and only if a potential future event happens: 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The average price of all shares traded as a fraction of the payout is an estimate of the event's likelihood
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{The current price of shares as a fraction of the payout is an estimate of the event's likelihood}

 			Which of these statements about altcoins are true?
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Bitcoin has a higher "market capitalization" than all altcoins combined }
				\item Bitcoin is the most widely forked cryptocurrency
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Namecoin supports additional functionality such as domain-name registration that is not found in Bitcoin}

		  \vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
			\item\textbf{Interaction Between Bitcoin and Altcoins}\\ \\
			In a merge-mined altcoin scenario:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Bitcoin blocks include transactions from the altcoin 
				\item Altcoin block headers include a hash pointer to a Bitcoin block
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Bitcoin block headers include the merkle root of transactions for an altcoin block}

			Here are several ways in which new coins in an altcoin can be allocated to users. Which of these require changes to Bitcoin? 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item All coins in the altcoin are generated through (merge) mining and are allocated to miners
				\item Altcoin allocation is "grandfathered" from Bitcoin - every owner of bitcoins becomes the owner of a certain number of altcoins (in a fixed proportion of bitcoins to altcoins)
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Bitcoin is used as a "reserve currency" for the altcoin - a unit of the altcoin can be created by putting 1 BTC into escrow; the bitcoin can be released by provably destroying one altcoin unit}
				\item A unit of the altcoin is created by provably destroying one bitcoin

			\item\textbf{The Block Chain as a Vehicle for Decentralization}\\ \\
 			In the smart property scenario presented, where Alice sells her car to Bob via an atomic transaction:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Bob must make sure that Alice deletes her private key so that she does not retain the ability to activate the car
				\item Alice and Bob must be physically near the car for the transfer of control to take effect
				\item Requires modifications to Bitcoin because there is no way for two different people who don't trust each other to securely sign the same transaction
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{The protocol doesn't prove to Bob, before the sale, that the transaction output that Alice wants to sell him actually corresponds to the car he wants to buy}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{It is problematic if the state does not recognize a block chain based notion of property because the state will always be the final arbiter}

				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Cryptographic security lacks the corrective controls of real-world security such as prosecution of criminals}
				\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.2,0.8,0.2}{Losing a device containing your private keys could result in the inability to use your smart property}
